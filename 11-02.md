## Storage Technologies
 
 * **Principle of Locality of Reference**
     - if you fetch something from memory, the odds are, the next thing you need will be located right next to it
 * **The Jacquard Loom** was one of the first devices to used stored instructions (for weaving)
     - this device read holes in a chunk of wood
     - These holes represented binary code
 * Ada Lovelace realized that this type of stored instruction could be used to control Babbage's adding machine
     - this is why she is credited as the first programmer
 * The evolution of this idea was the Hollerith **punch card**
     - introduced in the 1960's
 * Next was the discovery that magnetism could be used to store bits.
     - the first devices to use this technology was called **core memory**
 * core memory gave way to a better format called **drum memory**
     - bits were stored on a big rotating cylinder
 * eventually **rotating disks** were introduced
     - data could be written on the top and bottom of a disk, with several of them stacked together
* inside the computer, solid state devices started being used for their small size and high speed
    - this was done after the advent of the transistor, and the integrated circuit
    - some of these devices were _read-only_ and some were 'electronically erasable'
        + an ultraviolet light was used to zap the data on the memory
        + could only be rewritten a certain number of times
* things eventually progressed to where we are today, with small chips of RAM holding large amounts of data

#### Static RAM
* the first implementation of this kind of memory was called a **flip-flop**
    - can be set to one of two states, and it would hold that until it got a signal, causing it to change

#### Dynamic RAM
* simplified the memory chip and made production cheaper
* based on a design of one capacitor per bit
* since the charge can leak out on a capacitor, there was a special _refresh line_ that would recharge the capacitors so they could keep their data indefinitely

### Non-Volatile RAM
* this type of memory never forgets the data it stores

#### Read Only Memory
* these get programmed at manufacture time and the contents are never changed

#### Flash Memory
* this type of memory is super small and cheap
* one downside is that it will eventually give out
    - this number of allowable writes has increased, from 10's of thousands to 100's of thousands

### BOSCH
* early kind of virtual machine
* built entirely in software, without using any resources from host machine
* **cache memory** is the fastest available, but very expensive

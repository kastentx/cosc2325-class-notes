### Next Wednesday will be a free day (Work on Group Project)

# Clusters
* good way to play with parallel processing
* **Docker** is a cool program that helps set up clusters
    * there is a layer at the bottom that manages the other machines

## Lab #9
* deals with interrupts
* Two actions happening: 
    - One thing happens about 4000 times per second
    - Another thing happens a couple times a second
        * can be set to run based on interrupts
* Copy the files over from the ArduinoAsm repo, add the lab code, and things _should_ run
* when an interrupt happens, it can call functions to fire off the actions
    - the one that happens less frequently will have a counter that is incrememnted before the action is taken
* the different tasks need a way to talk to each other
    - in assembly, pretty much all variables are global
* **Cooperative Tasking System** - everybody gets full control of the machine and passes it off when done

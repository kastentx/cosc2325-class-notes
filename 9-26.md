# Grades in Blackboard
* can be changed if needed

# if...then...else
* **flowchart** are used to represent conditional if statements
* a _diamond_ symbol is used to denote an 'if'
    - one line comes out representing what to do when _'true'_
        + code within the block is executed
    - one line comes out representing what to do when _'false'_
        + program **jumps** to another place in the code (skipping 'true' section)
    - the flowchart continues to show sequence of operations after the if/else block is complete
* subtraction can be used to see if two items are equal
    - if A - B == 0, you know that the items are equal
    - if A - B > 0, you know that A is _larger_ than B
    - if A - B < 0, you know that A is _smaller_ than B
* two kinds of _jumps_ are used to make conditional statements work
    - **absolute** jumps: when the 'true' block is finished, jump over the 'false' code
    - **conditional** jumps: if the answer is false, go somewhere else in the code
* `cmp A,B` is the command used to compare A & B
    - there are several components to this instruction
        + **mnemonic**: the (
        + ) name of the command
        + **operands**: the 'variable names' of data being operated on
* `JNE address1` means '**J**ump if **N**ot **E**qual'
    - only causes a jump if the associated _compare_ evaluates to false

# Cycsi - Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)
* not all _mnemonics_ will be the same accross all machines and assemblers
* Machine has to be told specifically told what to do

### Data Movement
* to move data, a **MOV** command is used, which actually copies data from source to destination
* two types of memory known to the machine
    - **Register**: Inside the chip
    - **RAM**: Outside the chip
* Pentium chips require two moves to complete the process (can't go from place to place in memory)
    - one move into the chip
    - one move off the chip

### Arithmetic
* **ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV** operations are all standard
    - some machines don't include specific multiply/divide methods
* Pentium can only add two numbers when one is on the chip
    - its even faster to bring both numbers on the chip
* takes 2 operands: source and destination
    - the result is placed at the destination address

### Logic
* Standard Boolean operators:
    - **AND, OR, XOR, NOT**
        + these operate bitwise (except NOT which complements all the bits)
        + AND can be used to set a bit
        + XOR can be used to flip a bit
    - each takes two operands, source and destination
        + final result is stored in the desitination

## Control Instructions

### Unconditional Branch
* we will provide the classic 'jump' instruction
    - **JMP** dest

### Conditional Branch
* these jumps only occur according to certain values of the machines _status bits_

### Procedures
* needed to call and return subroutines (functions)
    - **CALL** dest 
        + current address is stored in a stack so data isn't lost after the jump to destination
        + like a _jump_ with memory
    - **RET**
        + returns things to the address stored on the stack
            * pops the most recent element from stack
        + allows for recursion and things like that

### Miscellaneous Instructions
* need a way to send parameters to procedures
    - **PUSH** source
    - **POP** destination

### Input/Output
* Simple Algorithm for adding numbers from input
* user inputs a number (1 for example)
* user inputs second number (2 for example)
    - first number is multiplied by 10
    - second number is added to the first
* this process continues for each subsequent digit

### Encoding Instructions
* there needs to be a way to encode operands with the instructions attached to them

### Office Hours
* Come see the professor!

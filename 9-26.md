# if...then...else
* **flowchart** are used to represent conditional if statements
* a _diamond_ symbol is used to denote an 'if'
    - one line comes out representing what to do when _'true'_
        + code within the block is executed
    - one line comes out representing what to do when _'false'_
        + program **jumps** to another place in the code (skipping 'true' section)
    - the flowchart continues to show sequence of operations after the if/else block is complete
* subtraction can be used to see if two items are equal
    - if A - B == 0, you know that the items are equal
    - if A - B > 0, you know that A is _larger_ than B
    - if A - B < 0, you know that A is _smaller_ than B
* two kinds of _jumps_ are used to make conditional statements work
    - **absolute** jumps: when the 'true' block is finished, jump over the 'false' code
    - **conditional** jumps: if the answer is false, go somewhere else in the code
* `cmp A,B` is the command used to compare A & B
    - there are several components to this instruction
        + **mnemonic**: the (
        + ) name of the command
        + **operands**: the 'variable names' of data being operated on
* `JNE address1` means '**J**ump if **N**ot **E**qual'
    - only causes a jump if the associated _compare_ evaluates to false

### Processor Stalls
* When going to slower types of memory for data, processor must be stalled to compensate
* Designers have created **wait signals** to implement this

### Error Handling
* Errors can happen at any stage of a program
* **exception-handling** is a new concept, introduced to help handle errors
* if a failure is detected, the program goes further up the call stack to see if it can be resolved
* in C++ the solution is called the **try-catch scheme**
    - if an error is detected, the function **throws** an error message
    - outside the function is a wrapper
    - the funciton is called in the **try** block
    - in the **catch** block is the code to execute if an error has been thrown
    - in Python there is a similiar scheme called _try-except_

### Encoding Instructions
* once you define your _Instruction Set Architecture_ you need to encode the instructions
* this allows you to use the mnemonics and operands that we're used to (human readable)

#### Flags
* single bit in size
* these watch over the **state** of the machine
* **ZF** - the Zero Flag
    - this bit gets set to 1 if a _zero_ is generated
* **SF** - the Sign Flag
    - this bit gets set to 1 if the result is _negative_
* **OF** - the Overflow Flag
    - indicates if the result of an integer operation is too big or too small to store

#### Operands
* **SRC**
    - stands for _Source_
        + source can be a:
            * literal
            * variable name or instruction label (memory address)
            * register contents (R1)
            * [1235] contents of memory at this address
            * [varName] contents of variable (at address where varName is stored)
            * [R1] contents of memory whose address is in R1
* **DEST**
    - stands for _Destination_

#### Registers
* we will name them R0 - R7

#### Data Movement Instructions
* **MOV**

#### Arithmatic Instructions
* The form used for these is `OP DEST SRC` where OP is one of the defined instructions below.
    - **ADD**
    - **SUB**
    - **MUL**
    - **DIV**

#### Branch Instructions
* **JMP** Operand

##### Conditional Jump Statements
* **JE**
    - jump if _equal_
* **JNE**
    - jump if _not equal_
* examples for greater than, less than, greater/equal to, etc.

#### Procedure Instructions

### Stack Operations

### Logic Operations



## Test Stuff
* Exam 1 review questions are up on Blackboard
    - look at them before monday of next week
    - **TEST is Wednesday**

##### Test Taking Process
1. First take test with no book
2. Get test handed back
3. Take test a second time, but open book
4. Get back half of your missed points for corrections

## Side Notes
* [Association of Computing Machinery](https://www.acm.org/)
    - good organization to join for CS career
* [IEEE](https://www.ieee.org/index.html)
    - Electrical and Electronics Engineers


##### Build Process
1. Editor 
2. Compiler 
3. Linker 
4. Loader

* It takes **10 times** the amount of code to do something in assembly than it would in a high level language

* GPU is the fastest number-crunching component in the computer

##### value/reference bug found by professor on IBM supercomputer
```
print(3.4)
SUBA(3.4)
print(3.4)

SUBA(x)
    x = x + 1
END
```

* when you pass by **reference**, you tell the computer the _address_ of your data
    - if changes are made to that data in a function, the data WILL be changed
* when you pass by **value**, you tell the computer the _value_ of your data
    - if changes are made to that data in a function, the original data WILL NOT be changed

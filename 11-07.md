## Superscalar Execution
* In a **single-cycle machine** everything happens in one loop of the four step
    - this can be bad, because it is leaving things idle that could be working
* The idea of superscalar is that one machine can control multiple devices at the same time
* with multiple pathways, a register/memory cell can perform multiple _reads_, but only one _write_ at a time

### Alternative to the single-cycle method
* _fetch_ needs to talk to instruction memory
* _fetch_ talks to decode
* _decode_ also needs to be able to talk to instruction memory
* _decode_ talks to execution
* _execution_ talks to data memory

### Pipelining
* use these alternative pathways to enable components to keep working after _their_ specific task is done
    - if fetch is done, and decode is working on an instruction.. fetch can go again!
        + these extra (early) instructions can be put in a **instruction buffer**
* decode will then check the instruction buffer first
    - if decode is done early, it can put decoded instructions in a **decoded code buffer**   
* execution will then check the _decoded code_ buffer first
* execution can have multiple ALU units available, to execute multiple decoded instructions simultaneously

### Thinking in Parallel

```
R3 <- R1 + R2
R6 <- R4 + R5
```

* There is no reason these two operations couldn't happen at the same time
* They are using different registers, so there is no overlap/conflict

### Dealing with Hazards

* In general, hazards are things that cause issues when we are trying to build a machine
    - they can be caused when we ask the processor to execute instructions with overlapping data requirements
* Some common hazards deal with register (re)naming and branches

## Revisiting the Four-Step
#### Branch Prediction
* we need to set up a table to analyze branching patterns
    - needs to be available to set up processing

## Group Project 2

### Arduino Accessories
* **8x8 LED Display**
    - a matrix of lights
* **16x2 LCD Display**
    - used for text, like a calculator screen
* **Pan/Tilt Camera Mount**
    - two servo mechanism
* **Membrane Keypad**
    - acts as a keypad and can be connected easily to an Arduino project
* **IR Decoder**
    - allows you to interact with the arduino through a remote control
* **Joystick Experiments**
    - you can use analog or switch position
* **Sonar Obstacle Detector**
    - sends out a 'ping' to see how close an obstacle is
* **LED Fader**
    - by using PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) a light appears to be on by a series of pulses
        + full brightness is on all the time
        + full darkness is off all the time
    - this effect can be used on a tri-color LED to generate many colors
* **Rotary Encoder LED Ring**
    - like a volume knob on a car stereo
    - has a knob, and lights that can be programmed to follow the knob
* **Servo Actuators**
    - a single motor that works in one range of motion
* **Temperature/Humidity Sensor**
    - measures temp and humidity
    - good for a simple weather station
* **NERF GUN!**

### Arduino Assembly
* Two ways of keeping track of time:
    - **polling** look at the time and see what it is
    - **interrupt** have an interrupt signal occur at a set time
* Clock Config
    - 3 bits passed to the _control register_ will determine the **counting rate**
    - 8 bit timers run from 0 to 255
        + they set a flag when rolling over
            * this is where an interrupt would go, if desired
    - there is a _counter register_ that hold the counter value 
    - there is an _overflow register_ that contains the interrupt info
        + `skip` almost always has `jmp` with it

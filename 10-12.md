#### Good Books:
* There are no electrons (electronics for mere mortals)
* Godel, Escher, Bach: An eternal golden braid

## Looking Ahead
* One step below the programming language is Assembly Language
    - we want to now go one step below _that_: to the hardware

### Lab 3
* System-C will be used
    - allows you to define a processor in software, run it, and see the electrons moving around
    - specs can be output to a file that can be sent to a machine shop to be built

### Four Step Architecture (in diagram form)
![BNF DIAGRAM](http://www.co-pylit.org/courses/cosc2325/_images/blockdiag-7db9f0923f3a015ec17a77fe6716bfa2897bb140.png)

### ALU details
* needs two 32-bit input values
* produces one 32-bit result

* On output, we need the result, and a set of status bits. As defined in our machine, we define these bits:
    - **OVF** - the result was too big for a 32-bit register
    - **SGN** - set if the result is negative, cleared if zero or plus
    - **ZF** - set if the result was zero cleared otherwise

* How many signal lines are needed?
    - 32 input lines for `op1`
    - 32 input lines for `op2`
    - 32 output lines for `alu_res`, the final output result
    - 3 output bits for the status flags
    - 3 input bits to identify the operation to perform. (four math, four logic)
        + add, subtract, multiply, divide
        + or, and, xor, not

### Memory Unit / Processor Interface
* **MAR** - the Memory Address Register, which holds the address data going to the memory
* **MDR** - the Memory Data Register, which holds data going to/from the memory


## Cycsi RTL Specification
![whiteboard diagram](http://www.co-pylit.org/courses/cosc2325/_images/CycsiInternals.png)

* Intel has never published their micro-code specifications
* They don't allow both SRC and DEST to be from Memory
    - there can only be one address in an instruction


## Upcoming Assignment
* Lab 3
    - group assignment
* Rather than build out a full implementation of the Cycsi Machine...
    - we will look over example code provided with the **SystemC** toolset
    - uses **macros** to provide a set of _hardware description constructs_ that get converted into C++
        + we aren't going to be working with the actual C++ code
        + our focus will be on _defining the machine_
* Professor will be putting up notes soon that help us install/set up System
    - he will also tell us what exactly needs to be turned in
* There are some tutorials avaulable from UTs website
* To install:
    - clone from github
    - follow the steps in the readme

## RED ALERT!!
* cycsi presentation is MONDAY NEXT WEEK

## Test Corrections Due Monday
* include correct answer, the source it came from, why you got it wrong

### Other Notes
* **MAKE** is the godfather of all programmer's tools
    - can even be used in conjunction with a project created in an IDE
* [Bitwise Operators](http://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial/bitwise_operators.html)
    - `|=` [Bitwise Or-Equals] (http://www.cplusplus.com/forum/general/29232/)

## Intro to the Arduino Sample Code
* sample code is up on professor's github
    - includes aBlink, written in assembly
    - also include cBlink, written in C
* `#define` is used to substitute text for the label name
    - sort of like a variable but it is just representing text
* `PORTB` is a register name on the chip
    - identifies 8 I/O pins
    - in the example, we're using pin 5
        + we call it the `LED_PIN`
* `~` is the NOT operator in C
* `CPU_PRESCALE(0)` tells the chip to run at full speed (16 MHz)
* we need to configure the board so we know which ports are input/output
    - in this case, we set the LED_PIN up for output
* we also set up the clock so it functions how we want
* we set the LED_OFF at first, so we know what we're starting with
* the `while(1)` loop continues forever
    - 1 is always true, so it creates an infinite loop
* `_delay_ms(500)` creates a delay of 500 ms, or 1/2 a second
    - can do this by running a loop
    - may need to use nested loops to get to a high enough count

### TO BUILD
* go into the parent directory and type `make`
    - target = cBlink _the filename you want_
    - CSRCS = $(wildcard *.c) _selects all files with the extension as a 'c source'_
    - INTTBL = FALSE _not needed yet, so leave it false_
    - MCU = atmega328p _the type of chip_
    - F_CPU = 16,000,000 _processor speed_
    - MAKE_BASE = _choose one of these_
        + one if you want them in the local dir
        + one if you want them on your computer
* Make will be able to tell what type of system it is running on
    - $(OS) will equal 'Windows_NT' on a windows machine
    - UNAME_S = $(shell uname -s)
        + this will tell you Linux or Darwin (for mac)
* show verbose output during compile and upload (to see lots of stuff)
* **NOTE:** There is at least one typo in AVRMakefileMac.mak

### TO RUN
* code.S -> code.o
    - converted with avr-gcc
* .o files -> code.elf
    - object file format, common in linux
* code.elf -> code.hex
    - ascii text file
    - used by loader (avrdude)

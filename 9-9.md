# Numbers
+ base means the number of symbals used
+ biggest number you can write in n bits = 2^n - 1

## Binary
+ Instead of 0-9, only use 0-1
+ Binary uses base 2 notation (8 digits AKA bits)

### Two's Complement Notation
+ Two bits are added to a standard 8 bit number 
+ To make the number negative, change the the leftmost bit to '1'
+ Flip all the remaining bits to their opposite value (0's become 1, 1's become 0)
+ 9th bit is extra and is not used

## Hex
+ Hexadecimal numbers use base 6 notation
	- allows you to represent a 4 bit quantity with one symbol

# Floating-point Decimals
+ Uses Scientific Notation to represent decimal numbers
	- Mantissa = significant number
	- Exponent = decimal point adjustment

# Symbols
+ ASCII character set conatins 128 different Symbols

# Colors
+ 3 colors are used (Red, Green, Blue)
	- Each color can have a different value (0-255)
+ All colors combined = White
+ Absence of all colors = Black

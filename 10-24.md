## Managing Registers
* All the registers in the processor work like global variables
    - the information contained in them is accessible to everything
* local variables can be implemented by using the **stack**
* **RSP** is a register that's generally used to manage subprograms
    - don't mess with it if possible
* In the lab, RAX is one of the two operands 
    - RAX and RDX used to implement multiplication
* the **Application Binary Interface** is an IEEE standard for naming registers
    - this allows different platforms and languages to interact
* Rule #1: any outbound parameters come back as RAX
* Some registers are _preserved_ because their values are needed by the 'caller'

`MOV RAX [RBP+16]` is the syntax for putting a local variable into RAX

* this is similar to the syntax used for dealing with arrays
* the 'leave' instruction is just a combination of:
    - `MOV RSP RBP`
    - `POP RBP`
    - `RET`

* Optimizations are good, but don't use them when learning/deciphering ASM code
    - they can make things much more complicated in order to run faster

## Working with Parts of Registers
* using XOR on a register is the fastest way to set it to zero
    - since XOR returns zero if both inputs are the same
* to use an 8 bit number in a 64 bit register, it is first filled with zeros, then use the appropriate label to work on the low 8 bits
    - **AL**- low 8 bits
    - **AH**- bits 8-15 (weird, I know, ask Intel why)
    - **AX**- low 16 bits
    - **EAX** - low 32 bits
    - **RAX** - full 64 bits

##### Make sure for every “push” you write, there is a matching “pop” in the block of code you are writing. DO not get things mixed up, or chaos will result.

* pop must be used in reverse order from how values were pushed onto the stack
    - otherwise, you'll end up swapping the values!
    - this is like using a temp variable, except you're using the stack
* loop syntax is similar to C, but you can't use `RCX` like you would `i`


## Lab info
* in the 'numbers.asm' file, we can delete the reference to rcx (not used)
* shifting the bit over 1 is a faster, more efficient way of multiplying by two
* the '42s' in the tests can be replaced with actual implementations

#### converting to binary
* assume number is zero
* check first digit
* convert to binary
* subtract code for zero from that digit

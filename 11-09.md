# Embedded Machines

## Microcontrollers
* these are small, special purpose computers that are designed to be embedded in a device
* the Arduino board we will be using has an 8 bit processor
    - the Atmel AVR microcontroller is popular due to its low cost
* the **Internet of Things** is the network of devices with embedded microcontrollers
* **pulse-width modulation** is a method of turning a power source on and off at a rapid rate to control the voltage output
    - used with LED signs, model trains, dimmed lights, and more
* the speed of the arduino is 16 MHz
    - this is much slower than something like a 4 GHz processor
    - much faster, however, than an old computer with 1 MHz
    - the human eye can only see about 60 fps, or 60 Hz

### Internals of the Chip
* interrupt unit - between store and the next fetch, gives an opportunity for another program to take control
* watchdog timer - independant agent that makes sure the machine is running properly
    - performs the same function as ctrl-alt-del for embedded machines that have to stay on
    - takes some kind of action if something is taking too long
* analog comparator works with A/D conversion

### Memory Layout
* Boot Flash Section loads the rest of the system
    - can be sent a signal via USB that prepares the system for action
    - puts the device in boot mode and loads a program
* Contains 32 general purpose registers
    - boring names, from R0 to R31
* 64 Input/Output registers
    - used for memory-mapped I/O
* 160 special purpose registers
    - interfaces with the extra modules and gadgets connected to the chip
* most registers are 8 bits wide
    - the last 6 registers can be double up to be used as 16 bit
        + in this form, they are called X, Y, and Z
* some of the other registers include:
    - program counter
    - stack pointer
    - status register (flags)

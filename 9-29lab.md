# Shifting Bits
* when you shift the bits of an 8 bit number to the left by one, you **multiply** by 2
    - to multiply by 7, slide to the left by three positions, subtract one out
        + essentially multiplying by 8, and then subtracting by one to get to 7
* to **divide** by 2, shift the bits to the right by one
* in C++ you can do this with the '>>' and '<<' operators

## Our Project
* will require us to **decode** instructions
    - we'll need to determine whether or not a fetched instruction is complete, or if we need to go back for a second chunk

## Office Hours 
* 10am - noon on Saturday

# Performance Analyzation
* If you're testing the speed of an algorithm, make sure you also account for the overhead
    - loading data, printing output, etc.
* there are tools that will identify the _hot spots_ of the code
    - this tells you what should be worked on to improve performance

## Random Number Generator
* Random numbers from the RNG aren't _really_ random
    - they are psuedo-random, becuase they could be repeated
    - seeding a random number generator with the time, or another number, can make them appear more random-like
        + another approach is to take the last 10 packets that went over the network adapter
* Typically the number given is between 0 and 1
    - you can do conversions on this number to get what you want

## Analysis
* after running a test multiple times, we can plot the data in Excel
    - this can be automated with Python!
* The graph that will be output is a polynomial
    - finding the equation for this graph will let you estimate values for large data sets
        + much better than sitting and waiting for 10 million items to sort!

### Types of graphs 
* an exponential graph grows very quickly
* a polynomial is better than exponential
* logarithmic is better
* linear is better still
* the best ever would be constant

## Bubble Sort
* working a stack of numbers
1. are the first two numbers in order? if no, swap em
2. keep going and continue swapping if needed
3. keep going until you reach the end of the array
4. keep making passes through the stack until it's sorted

* this algorithm has a formula to model how much work is being done 
    - first loop does (n - 1)
    - inner loop does (n - 1)
    - if statement is true half the time so (1 + .5*3)
    - multiply these together to get (n-1)(n-1)(1+.5*3)
* the graph of this equation is almost identical to the graph of actual run times

### Lab 6
* clone the repo, then run `make`
* tweak the code so it does fibonacci instead of factorial

#### sidenote
* if make isn't working it could be due to the c++11 syntax
    - for example, the `catch` module requires c++11
    - you can add the -atd=c++11 -g flag to recitfy this
* MUL implies RAX is the other number being used
    - the answer is stored in RAX
    - this is not shown anywhere, so *you have to know it*

## Fibonacci Number / Factorial

``` 
Fact:     ; RDI has parameter
MOV     RAX, 1
CMP     RDI, 0
JZ      f_exit

PUSH    RDI
DEC     RDI
CALL    FACT
POP     RDI
MUL     RDI

f_exit:

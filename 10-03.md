### Test on Wednesday
* work on review (posted on site)

## Memory Container Sizes
* 1 bit = a 1 or a 0
* 1 nibble = 4 bits
* 1 byte = 8 bits
* 1 word = 2 bytes = 16 bits
* 1 DWORD = 2 words = 4 bytes = 32 bits

## Number Systems
* **base** means how many sybols are used
* the symbols can be anything (letters, numbers, even made up)
* good to know first 16 numbers because thats what can be made with **4 bits** 
* we use a letter indicating the base.. because 101 could mean multiple things
    - better not to _assume_ what the standard is (decimal, binary, hex)
* an easy way to convert to binary is:
    - divide by two

## Machine Behavior
* has _no knowledge_ of what kind of data it's loading (code, numbers)
    - capable of loading **data, instructions, and junk**
* uses **sequential memory** to keep things in order
    - especially useful with data types that are larger than 1 byte
    - for example, an int in c++ is 4 bytes
* two ways to order this memory 
    - **Big Endian** goes from most significant bit to least
    - **Little Endian** goes from least significant bit to least

## Negative Numbers
* **two's complement notation**
    - leftmost bit is a 0 if positive, and a 1 if negative
* sign extension allows you to use large numbers with two's complement
    - adding two signed 8 bit quantities will give you a 9 bit answer
        + throw away the leading one

## Texas Four Step
* **Fetch**
    - uses _program counter_ to find first instruction
* **Decode**
    - looks up instruction from a table of _known instructions_
    - depending on how big the current instruction is, update the program counter
        + how big is the instruction?
        + how many additional bytes are required for the instruction to be complete?
        + update the program counter based on how big current instruction is
* **Execute**
    - do whatever the instruction says to do
    - if you need to, update memory to complete the instruction
* REPEAT THE CYCLE!

## Virtual Machines
* just software version of a computer
* possible for a VM of the computer its running on to run _faster_ than the computer its running on

## four step loop
* there is a simple loop to illustrate this 

```
while(true) {
    fetch();
    decode();
    execute();
    store();
}
```

## Machine State
* the 0's and 1's that are located in the machine between steps

## Registers
* memory located on the processor chip
* it is for speed!
* 30 registers is a pretty standard number to have

## executable file
* instructions and data
    - code
    - initialized data
    - uninitialized junk data
* gets loaded by the loader (part of Operating System)

## Von Neumann vs Harvard
* Harvard splits up the code from the data
    - downside is you need two memory units
    - upside is no accidental fetching of data

## Speed
* you can't just speed up a processor clock to make a machine go faster
    - because you need things arriving at the precise correct times
* RAM is slower than registers for several reasons
    - it is further away 
    - other reasons that we haven't gotten into yet

## Pipelining
* how can it speed up a system?

## Assembly Language
* contains three parts
    - code
    - variables
    - initialized data (and uninitialized data)
* written for hoomans
    - machine language is for machines

## process of making a program
* code editor
* assembler/compiler
* linker reads object files and brings in code you `include`
* loader runs it

## commands
* mnemomic + operands
    - `mov rax, 123`

## pentium
* wont let you operate on two memory locations
* you have to bring stuff onto the chip, operate on it, then put it back

## literal number
* takes no memory
* doesn't have a locatino
* located in the instruction itself

## Backus-Naur Form
* mathematically precise rules for a programming language
* useuful because computers aren't smart enough to accept mistakes
    - "go lake in the jump" example

## CISC vs RISC
* CISC is more **Complex**
* RISC is the **Reduced** 
* ISC means Instruction Set Computer
    - types of processor architecture

## Logical Operators
* machine looks at these thigns bit by bit
* AND
* OR
* XOR
* NOT

## Status Flags
* ALU is the only component that can create a status indicating something has changed
* CMP instruction uses the ALU to subtract, but uses the outcome to do something instead of storing

## Procedure
* processor doesn't actually know anything about procedures
* you have to **call** a procedure, and then **return** to where you were
    - **call** saves the return address to the stack
    - **return** pops that address from the stack and returns to it

## end
* what happens when you reach the end of a program?
    - return gives control back to the operating system

#### Use AND to strip bits off of a binary value
* How is this done? why is it done?

##### System C
* allows you to describe hardware in software
* generates a simulation to see if the machine works the way you want
* **Dynamc Libraries** are used to load the right code for things currently running
* allows you to look at the **Register Transfer Layer**

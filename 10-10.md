### Reigster Transfer Level

* Register's Hold State (clocked)
    - combinatorial components affect a change of state
* uses VHDL
    - Verilog Hardware Description Language

* MAR - Memory Address Register
* MDR - Memory Data Register

* to perform a **write**, you must provide memory with both _an address_ and _data_
    - MEM[ADR] <- MDR

* to perform a **read**, _you_ provide the address, and _the memory_ responds with data
    - MDR <- MEM[MAR]
    - just like programming language syntax: 
        + varName = Data[i]

* adding two numbers
    - MEM[MAR] -> R1
    - MEM[MAR] -> R2
    - R3 <- R1 + R2
    - MEM[MDR] <- R3

* or this way (C = A + B)
    - MAR <- VAR A
    - R1 <- MEM[MAR]
    - MAR <- VAR B
    - R2 <- MEM[MAR]
    - R3 <- R1 + R2
    - MAR <- VAR C
    - MEM[MAR] <- R3
* (each one of these steps is the tick of a clock)

* RTL was designed to eliminate the need the to draw out the hardware
* t0: r1 <- r2, r3 <- r4
    - possible to do these at the same time if there are parallel routes
    - the t0 part is called the **condition**
    - the r1 <- r2 part and r3 <- r4 parts are called **transfers**
    - since they are both set up to happen at the same time they are in **parallel**

#### different hardware design languages
* system C -> C++ HDL
* MyHDL -> Python HDL

* R1 <- R2
* R1 <- R2 + R3
* R1 <- R2 - R3
* R1 <- R1 * R3
* R1 <- R1 / R3
* R1 <- NOT R2
* R1 <- R2 AND R3
* R1 <- R2 OR R3
* R1 <- R2 XOR R3

# Jon Von Neumann
* mathemetician working in Britain
* working for the war effort w/ guys like Alan Turing
* presented his teams ideas in a clear, concise way that is still used today
    - explained that an electrical device with a stored program could process data

## The Machine
* not a 'one task' machine like Turing's
* decided that doing math was not enough, the machine needed logic
    - called an **ALU** (Arithmatic/Logic Unit)
* came up with the term **memory** unit to describe storage space
    - data was stored in memory at a specific **address**
    - there is no such thing as memory with _nothing_ in it
        + 'empty' space has some kind of unknown/unusable data put there
    - abbreviated as **CM** (central memory) or simply **M**
* the **control unit** was in charge of making decisions
* had a unit in charge of input/output

# The Computer Dance
* we use an **oscillator** to create a 'beat' for the computer to follow
    - a circuit that changes from a '0' to a '1' and back again
    - speed of the oscillator is controlled by a crystal that sets the signal speed
        + this is the thing running at 2.6 GHz!
        + each cycle is one Hertz (**Giga-Hertz** is one billion per second)

## The Computer's Steps
* **Fetch**
    - the control unit _fetches_ an instruction from memory
    - in a pentium, instructions are between 1 and 15 bytes long
    - CU maintains an address for memory that's initialized at startup
* **Decode**
    - since the instructions are encoded, it is _decoded_ to check for validity
    - determines if an instruction is longer and needs more bytes to be fetched
* **Execute**
    - once all the data needed for the instruction is available, perform that action
    - may involve routing data to the ALU or Input/Output
    - data may be retrieved during this step, for example back from the ALU
* **Store**
    - the last step of the process may often involve putting results back into memory
    - this step is sometimes referred to as 'retirement'
    - data may also be stored that contains information about what happened during execution
* _**this whole process gets repeated over and over!**_

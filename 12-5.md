# Networking Microcontrollers

## Serial Communications
* **Start Bit** and **Stop Bit**
* **Parity** - add up the number of ones, is it _even_ or _odd_?
    - if the received chunk has the same parity as the source, you know the data is good!
* data is 7 bits, to allow one extra bit for error checking
    - 9 bits on an 8 bit packet
        + can detect one error
    - 10 bits on an 8 bit packet
        + can fix one error and detect two
* There are couple of standard protocols w/ microcontrollers:
    - **SPI** - Serial Peripheral Interface
        + uses 3 wires (plus ground)
            * fast (1.6 Mbps)
    - **I2C** - Inter IC
        + uses 2 wires (plus ground)
            * not fast (100 kbps)

### SPI Communications
* There are a few pins on Arduino set up for SPI
    - located on PORTB
* SPI capable analog to digital converter - say wha?

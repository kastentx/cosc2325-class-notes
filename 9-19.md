# Sequential Circuits
* Fetch-Decode-Execute-Store

## Two State Circuit
* Uses Two inverters
* Hangs on to a bit and prevents it from changing

## Memory Cells

## Single Cycle Processor
* Where Cycsi got it's name

# Cycsi

## Modeling the Parts
* an **interrupt** is used to control which processes the CPU works on
* a **register** is a simple memory location located inside the processor chip
    - the fastest memory available, since the distance traveled by bits is so small

### Memory Unit

#### Memory Containers

#### Code Memory

#### Data Memory

## Implementing the machine

### C++ Notes
* Use `#pragma once` instead of `#ifndef HEADER_H` and `#DEFINE HEADER_H`

## Address Modes
* **base address** of an array points to the '0th' item
* when we calculate the actual address of something, it's called the **effective address**
* **forward references** are OK to use in assembly
    - allows you to use variables before they are defined
    - code runs twice, and inserts the definition the second time
* using square brackets means that we are going into memory
* the size of the **fetch** is determined by the size of the **destination**

## Addressing in Arrays
* in a 2 dimensional array:
    - first subscript is the **row**
    - second subscript is the **column**
* row major - strip off rows
* col major - strip off columns
`d[r][c]`
`d[2][1]`
`offset = 1 * 5 + 2`
* the '1*5' is saying that you're skipping over one row to get to the second
* the '+2' is telling you to go two columns over
* mem{r,c} = offset * size
* **scale** is the size of the offset
    - for example, if the scale is 4 bytes, an offset of 2 would equal 8 bytes

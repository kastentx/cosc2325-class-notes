# Boolean Algebra
* Only numbers - 0 and 1
* Only operations are:
	- **Adding** - called OR
		+ 0 + 0 -> 0
		+ 0 + 1 -> 1
		+ 1 + 0 -> 1
		+ 1 + 1 -> 1
	- **Multiplication** - called AND
		+ 0 * 0 -> 0
		+ 0 * 1 -> 0
		+ 1 * 0 -> 0
		+ 1 * 1 -> 1
		+ 
* Works with a true/false type value system

### AND
| A | B | OUT |
|---|---|-----|
| F | F | F   |
| F | T | F   |
| T | F | F   |
| T | T | T   |

### OR
| A | B | OUT |
|---|---|-----|
| F | F | F   |
| F | T | T   |
| T | F | T   |
| T | T | T   |

#### Example:
***
* A -> Boolean Value
	- A + 0 -> A
	- A * 0 -> 0
	- A + 1 -> 1
	- A * 1 -> A

* A 'bar' is equal to the _opposite_ of A
	- A + Ab -> 1
	- A * Ab -> 0

# Electricity
* moves around a computer much like water in a plumbing system
	- **capacitors** are like buckets that can store water (power)
	- **transistors** control the flow of power on/off
* the **ground** wire on a power supply connects to a chain that connects to ground
* a **switch** opens and closes to cut-off or supply power
	- two switches in a line are equal to a logical **AND** operator
		+ they both have to be in the ON position to supply power
	- two switches running in paralell are equal to a logical **OR** operator
		+ if either one of them is turned ON, power will be supplied
* Lots of power = lots of heat
	- lots of power also needs big batteries (if mobile)

## Digital Gates
* a **gate** stops the flow of electrons through it
	- will output a predetermined amount of power
	- can determine if certain boolean conditions are met
	- several can be hooked up in sequence to form complex _boolean algebra_
	- curved symbol is an **or**, a flat symbol is the **and** version
	- you can start with just NAND gates and end up with a fully functional PC
	- types of gates:
		+ AND
		+ OR
		+ NOT
		+ XOR also known as _exclusive or_ 
		+ NAND also known as _not and_
* **multiplexor** can select one input out of many and send it to an output
* **propogation delay** is the time it takes for power to reach the proper level for the state
	- limits how fast we can build machines (overclocking too fast can cause trouble)
	- 


## Demorgans Theoroms
* useful when needing to simplifying an expression

# Boolean Algebra
* Only numbers - 0 and 1
* Only operations are:
	- **Adding** - called OR
		+ 0 + 0 -> 0
		+ 0 + 1 -> 1
		+ 1 + 0 -> 1
		+ 1 + 1 -> 1
	- **Multiplication** - called AND
		+ 0 * 0 -> 0
		+ 0 * 1 -> 0
		+ 1 * 0 -> 0
		+ 1 * 1 -> 1
		+ 
* Works with a true/false type value system

## AND
| A | B | OUT |
|---|---|-----|
| F | F | F   |
| F | T | F   |
| T | F | F   |
| T | T | T   |

## OR
| A | B | OUT |
|---|---|-----|
| F | F | F   |
| F | T | T   |
| T | F | T   |
| T | T | T   |

### Example:
* A -> Boolean Value
	- A + 0 -> A
	- A * 0 -> 0
	- A + 1 -> 1
	- A * 1 -> A

* A 'bar' is equal to the _opposite_ of A
	- A + Ab -> 1
	- A * Ab -> 0

# Machine Process
1. **Fetch**
    + _RIP_ is the intel acronym for the PC register
    + Instruction Memory
    + Prefetch Buffer
2. **Decode** Register -> Micro Code
3. **Execute** 
    + Registers <-> **ALU**
    + Add / Calc
4. **Store**
    + Data Memory <-> **ALU**

* First the _control unit_ fires up the machine loop
* Register Transfer Language was used for a long time
* Now, VHDL is more advanced and popular
* _pipelining_ was a huge advance in handling instructions

### Memory
1. Hardware Layer
2. OS
3. Program Code
4. Initialized Data
5. Un-initialized Data
6. Heap _(grows upwards)_
7. Stack _(grows downwards)_

* the program dies when the stack and heap collide

### Model of a Computer
* Hardware
    - Power
    - Cooling
    - Communications
* OS
    - Device drivers
* Applications
* User

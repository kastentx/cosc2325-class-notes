# Computer Organization and Design: The Hardware/Software Interface
###### By David A. Patterson & John L. Hennessy

## Chapter 1

##### Embedded Computer
* a computer inside another device used for running one predetermined application or collection of software

##### Cloud Computing
* refers to large collections of servers that provide services over the internet
* some providers rent dynamically varying numbers of servers as a utility 

##### Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)
* delivers software and data as a service over the Internet, usually via a thin program such as a browser that runs on local client devices
    - as opposed to binary code that must be installed and runs wholly on the local device
* examples include: web search apps and social networking

##### Moore's Law
* states that integrated circuit resources double every 18-24 months
* resulted from a 1965 prediction made by Gordon Moore (one of the founders of Intel)

##### Pipelining
* a very prevalent pattern of paralellism
* simliar to the 'human-chain' approach used in putting out a fire (think old west movies)

##### Hierarchy of Memories
* a way of looking at the available memory as a pyramid
* fastest, smallest, and most expensive memory is at the top
* slowest, biggest, and cheapest memory makes up the bottom of the pyramid

##### Abstraction
* to go from a complex application to the simple instructions a computer understands involves several layers of software that interpret or translate high-level operations, providing abstraction

##### Systems Software
* the layer of software (abstraction) between Applications software and the Hardware itself
    - include operating system and compiler
        + an **Operating System** manages the resources of a computer for the benefit of programs that run on that computer
        + a **Compiler** translates high-level code into instructions the hardware can execute

##### Binary Digit
* one of the two numbers in base 2 (0 or 1) that are the components of information
    - also called a **bit**
* using numbers to represent instructions _and_ data is a foundation of computing

##### Assembly Language
* a symbolic representation of machine instructions
* created by early programmers who were tired of writing in binary
* a great improvement over binary, but requires one line for each instruction given
    - forces the programmer to think like a computer

##### Machine Language
* a binary representation of machine instructions

##### Assembler
* a program that translates a symbolic version of _instructions_ into the binary version
    - assembly language -> machine language
    - add A,B -> 1000110010100000

##### High-Level Programming Language
* a portable language such as C, C++, Java, or Visual Basic that is composed of words and algebraic notation
* allows programmeers to think in a more natural, human-like language
* allows programs to be developed independant of the computer on which they were developed
* languages can be designed according to their intended use
* can be translated by a compiler into assembly language
    - C++ -> Assembly language
    - A + B -> add A,B



#### Acronyms

* **PMD** - Personal Mobile Device
* **RAM** - Random Access Memory

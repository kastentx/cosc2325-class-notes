# Interrupts
* Global variables are everywhere in Assembly
    * this means that everything is competing for use of them
* The system used for controlling interrupts is called the Global Interrupt System
    * `CLI` is used to disable interrupts
    * `SEI` is used to enable interrupts
* General rule for interrupt handlers: make the code _short and fast_
* Interrupts _must_ be enabled with `SEI` before they will start working!
